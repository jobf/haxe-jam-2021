# haxe jam 2021

The theme for the jam is **overlords**

## Quick start

### Install Dependencies
```
haxelib install lime
haxelib install peote-view
haxelib install json2object
haxelib install peote-text
haxelib install hxmath
haxelib install echo
haxelib install zigcall
```

### Run

```
lime test html5
```

## Implementation notes

### Pear Shaped [ob.pear]

I am prototyping with a small framework I started which brings together echo for physics and peote-view for rendering.

For the jam, ob.pear lives in this repo, and any good bits will be migrated later.
